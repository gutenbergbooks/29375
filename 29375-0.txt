Ice for Commercial Purposes

Ice for commercial purposes is obtained in two ways: either by cutting
during the winter time from our lakes and rivers and storing in large
Ice Storage Houses located alongside, or by freezing pure clean water
by means of artificial refrigeration.

All authorities are agreed that artificial ice is more sanitary than
natural ice and it is only a matter of time when the use of natural
ice will be prohibited except in special cases when the purity of its
source of supply is beyond doubt.

Our improved method of making artificial ice will cut the labor cost
down to the minimum and will enable the manufacturer to profitably
sell artificial ice at the price natural ice can be harvested. The
logical result thereof will be the building of a large number of
modern ice plants all over the country to supply the market with
artificial ice in place of the present natural ice.

We do not claim any wonders for our system but believe that the
following points of advantage will convince any practical ice
manufacturer that the labor cost has been cut in two.

  First. We pull a complete row of the full width of tank at one time.

  Second. Our air supply is permanently connected to the cans and the
  supply to each can can be regulated, if required.

  Third. We have a continuous air supply to the cans during freezing
  as well as during thawing, dumping and filling. Our air supply never
  ceases.

  Fourth. Our air is automatically cooled down to the temperature of
  the brine in the tank thereby eliminating all possibility of
  moisture in the air pipes.

  Fifth. Our cans are held in a solid frame of steel work and are
  connected to the crane from the time the cans are pulled until they
  are put back into the tanks, thereby doubling the life of the cans.

We give herewith data covering the cost of manufacturing ice and will
guarantee that under reasonably fair management the number of men
required will not be exceeded.

Do not fail to carefully analyze the following cost data. They may seem
extremely low but a thorough study of our system will prove them to be
very conservative.

NUMBER ONE

Manufacturing Costs Per Ton of Ice
Using Electric Power at Present Chicago
Rates for Power and Labor

Capacity of plant, 240 tons of ice per day, using 2692 cans of 400-lb.
capacity.

18000-ton storage house.

Average current requirement for freezing one ton of ice, including
storage cooling and all auxiliaries, 55 K. W. hours.

Average cost per K. W. hour, .9 cent.

Current cost per ton of ice, 55 x .9, equals 49.6 cents.

Assuming one month's shut-down for inspection and repairs, the total
output of 240 tons of ice for 333 days amounts to 79,920 tons, or
roughly speaking 80,000 tons of ice.

Adding 1/2 cent per ton of ice for the required heating, the total
power cost of  making 80,000 tons of ice is (80,000 x .50)

                                              $ 40,000.00

ENGINE ROOM LABOR COST:

1 chief engineer per day      $ 10.00

3 engineers per day            $ 8.00

Total per day                 $ 34.00

365 days at $34.00 equals                     $ 12,410.00


or  12410 / 80000 = 15.62 cents per ton


[2]


ICE PLANT LABOR COST:

3 men pulling ice and setting
  it up in store-room.         per day $ 6.00

3 men in store-room            per day $ 6.00

1 shipping clerk               per day $ 8.00

Total labor                   per day $ 44.00

365 days at $44.00 equals                              16,060.00

For filling the winter
storage house and taking
the ice out of it will
require 3 additional men
for five months,
equals 150 days x $18.00, equals                      $ 2,700.00

           Total Ice Plant Labor Cost Equals          $18,760.00

or  18670 / 80000 = 23.46 cents per ton

240 tons of ice equal 1200---400-lb. cans. As 24 cans are pulled at
one time it requires 1200 / 24 = 50 pulls per day, or one pull every
29 minutes. The ice-puller has therefore ample time to set up all ice
pulled in storage house as directed.

Cost of Ammonia at         2 cent per ton     $ 1,600.00

Cost of Oil and Waste at   2 cent per ton     $ 1,600.00

Cost of Water at           3 cent per ton     $ 2,400.00

Cost of Salt at           72 cent per ton       $ 400.00

Plant Maintenance and Repairs                 $ 3,500.00


or  3500 / 80000 = 4.37 cent per ton


OFFICE EXPENSES:

1 Manager and Salesman, per year   $ 5,000.00

1 Bookkeeper, per year             $ 2,400.00

Stationery, Telephone, etc           $ 600.00

Total Cost                         $ 8,000.00

or  8000  / 80000 = 10 cent per ton

During the month of December, the Ice Plant will be shut down for
overhauling and repairs, and part of the ice stored during November
will be sold in December, therefore, requiring a total storage
capacity of 18,750 tons, of which 750 tons will be stored in the
ante-room and 18,000 tons will be stored in the big winter storage.

NOTE--These sales can only be realized if the dealer has at least
18,000 tons of natural ice on hand to enable him to take care of the
family trade during the hot months.

If no large supply of natural ice is on hand hardly 50,000 tons can be
sold, thereby increasing the cost per ton considerably.


POWER COST:

Due to numerous starting and stopping of compressor during the slack
months the maximeter charges will be higher and therefore it must be
assumed that 60 K. W. hours will be required per ton of ice instead of
55 K. W. hours for continuous consumption.

60 K. W. hours per ton of ice at .9 cent per K. W. hour equals 54
cents per ton. Adding 1/2 cent per ton for the required heating the
power cost for making 60,450 tons of ice equals 60,450 x 54.5 cents,
equals  $ 32,945.25

Manufacturing Costs Per Ton of Ice Using
Steam Power at Medium-Sized-Town Rates for Labor

160-ton capacity per day.

1,728--400-lb. cans.

333 days continuous full output.

12,000-ton storage house.


COST OF POWER:

A modern, highly efficient and economical steam driven high speed
compressor plant must be installed so as to get the maximum power out
of coal. The boiler room will contain two 250-H. P. water-tube boilers
with automatic stokers and coal bin overhead holding two weeks' supply
of coal. Steam pressure 175 lbs. As the firing of the boilers is
automatic and requires practically no work on the part of the
engineers, no firemen are needed. Ashes will also be removed
automatically. The engine room equipment will consist of two 175-ton
high speed compressors, direct connected to two Simple Condensing
Una-flow Engines; also two generators, two cooling tower water pumps,
two air compressors, switchboard, etc. All to be equipped with the
latest labor and power-saving devices.

Equipped as above, 25 tons of refrigeration can be easily obtained
from one ton of ordinary 12,500 B T U coal. 1.8 ton of refrigeration
is required to produce one ton of ice including the required cooling
of storage house.

Therefore the power cost of making one ton of ice with coal at $5.00
per ton equals $5.00 divided by  25/1.8 = 37 cent. (One cent per ton
of ice is added for heating of dipping tank water.)

Assuming one month's shut-down for inspection and repairs, the total
output of 160 tons of ice for 333 days amounts to 53,280 tons of ice.

The total power cost of making 53,280 tons of ice is therefore,
53,280 x 37 cent = $ 19,713.60

7,600-ton Storage House.


COST OF POWER:

A modern, highly efficient and economical steam driven high speed
compressor plant must be installed so as to get the maximum power out
of coal. The boiler-room will contain two 200-H. P. water-tube boilers
with automatic stokers and coal bin overhead holding two weeks' supply
of coal. Steam pressure 175 lbs. As the firing of the boilers is
automatic and requires practically no work on the part of the

Engines; also two generators, two cooling tower pumps, two air
compressors, switchboard, etc. All to be equipped with the latest
labor and power-saving devices.

Equipped as above, 25 tons of refrigeration can be easily obtained
from one ton of ordinary 12500 B T U coal. 1.8 tons of refrigeration
is required to produce one ton of ice, including the cooling of the
storage house.

Therefore, the power cost of making one ton of ice with coal at $5.00
per ton equals $5.00 divided by 25/1.8 = 37 cent. (One cent per ton of
ice is added for heating of dipping-tank water.)

Assuming one month's shut down for inspection and repairs, the total
output of 100 tons of ice for 333 days amounts to 33,300 tons of ice.

The total power cost of making 33,300 tons of ice is therefore,
33,300 x 37 cent, equals  $ 12,321.00

[Transcriber's Note]

I found this document and the attached papers and photographs among my
father's papers. I offer it as an insight into the finances and
structure of business and trades in the early 1900's.

There are no dates included in this document but a Google search of
"Otto Luhr" produced these items:

  Mechanical and Refrigerating Engineer's Handy Book; Otto Luhr; 1913.

  Automatic refrigerating liquid feeder and regulator;
  United States Patent 1725875; 8/27/1929.

  Refrigerator car; United States Patent 1642882; 9/20/1927.

Since the title page states "Patent Applied For", this document was
probably published around 1925.

Note the prices quoted for materials and labor:
Coal, $5.00 a ton.  [In 2009, about $100/ton, down from $300 in 2008.]
Unskilled Labor, $6.00/day; that's DAY, not HOUR.
Skilled Labor, $8 to $10/day
Electricity, $0.009/KWH  [my latest bill (in 2009) was $0.1317/KWH]

Note the job titles in the attached documents: Barnmen, Washers,
Blacksmiths

The word "MAINTAINANCE" is thus spelled in the original.

Finally, the optimistic tone of the document contrasts with the
decline of the ice business in the 1940's, fifteen years later. I
remember the ice deliveries and the weight sign my mother put in the
window before we got our first mechanical refrigerator after
World War II.
